"""Universal-lock uv environment driver for verl.

verl uses **one** ``uv.lock`` for the whole project. Every backend is a PEP
621 extra in ``pyproject.toml``; mutually exclusive ones are declared in
``[tool.uv].conflicts`` so a single ``uv lock`` resolves all of them into the
one lockfile. A job materializes exactly one conflict-free combination of
extras into the project venv (``.venv``) and runs everything — every Ray worker
group — from it. There is no per-backend lockfile.

**This driver is not on the normal path.** Ordinary runs need no install step
and no sync: they go straight through ``uv run``, which materializes ``.venv``
from the committed lock on first use, and Ray reaches the same environment via
``runtime_env.py_executable`` (that is what the ``examples/`` scripts and CI
do)::

    uv run --frozen --all-packages --extra vllm --extra fsdp python3 -m verl.trainer.main_ppo ...

Use this module for what ``uv run`` does not cover: regenerating ``uv.lock``,
keeping several environments side by side (``--name``), an activated shell,
protecting an in-house build (``VERL_UV_NO_INSTALL``), or baking a Docker
image's cache (``prefetch``)::

    python manage_envs.py lock                       # (re)generate uv.lock
    python manage_envs.py sync fsdp vllm             # build .venv explicitly
    source .venv/bin/activate                        # or: manage_envs.py shell ...
    python manage_envs.py run fsdp vllm -- python -m verl.trainer.main_ppo ...

Commands::

    lock                 # uv lock  -> regenerate the universal uv.lock
    sync   <extras...>   # uv sync --extra ...  -> materialize .venv up front
    run    <extras...> -- <cmd...>   # uv run --extra ... -- <cmd>
    shell  <extras...>   # sync, then open a shell with .venv activated
    list                 # extras, conflict rules, .venv state, prefetch plan
    clean                # remove .venv
    prefetch             # FIRST-TIME / Docker only: generate uv.lock, then
                         #   warm the uv cache with every backend's wheels &
                         #   source builds (see below)

Anything after ``--`` on ``lock`` / ``sync`` / ``prefetch`` is forwarded to
the underlying ``uv`` invocation, e.g.::

    python manage_envs.py sync megatron -- --reinstall -v

Naming distinct venvs
---------------------
By default every combination reuses the project venv ``.venv``. Add ``--name
NAME`` (or set ``VERL_VENV_NAME``) to keep several combinations side by side;
``.venv`` always tracks the one you synced most recently, so activation is
unchanged::

    python manage_envs.py sync --name vllm-mega vllm megatron
    python manage_envs.py sync --name sglang-fsdp sglang fsdp
    source .venv/bin/activate                    # = the sglang-fsdp env

``sync`` / ``run`` / ``shell`` / ``clean`` / ``list`` all take the same
``--name`` (for ``sync`` / ``run`` put it before the extras).

Keeping internal packages out of uv's hands
--------------------------------------------
If your site ships its own build of some package (e.g. an internal ``ray`` or
``wandb``) that ``uv sync`` must not overwrite or delete, set
``VERL_UV_NO_INSTALL`` to a space/comma-separated list of distribution names::

    export VERL_UV_NO_INSTALL="ray wandb"
    python manage_envs.py sync fsdp vllm     # everything except ray / wandb
    uv pip install <your internal ray / wandb wheels>   # then add your builds

``sync`` / ``shell`` then pass ``--no-install-package <name>`` (uv won't install
or replace it) plus ``--inexact`` (uv won't remove an already-installed build),
and ``run`` adds ``--no-sync`` so it executes in your curated ``.venv``
untouched. Only the named distribution is skipped — not its dependencies — and
an empty / unset value keeps uv's default exact sync. (uv has no env var of its
own for this, which is why it lives here.)

`sync` vs `prefetch`
--------------------
``sync`` installs one conflict-free extra combination into ``.venv`` up front —
the same thing a plain ``uv run`` does implicitly. ``prefetch`` is a
**first-time / image-build** helper: it first resolves the universal
``uv.lock`` from ``pyproject.toml`` (``uv lock``), then downloads & builds
*every* backend's dependencies into the uv cache (``$UV_CACHE_DIR``, default
``~/.cache/uv``) so later ``sync`` runs are fast/offline. Because the backends
conflict, ``prefetch`` cannot produce a single usable env — it syncs throwaway
envs purely to populate the cache (passing ``--no-install-project`` so only
dependencies are cached, not verl itself) and never creates or modifies
``.venv``. The lock it produces is what every later ``uv run`` / ``sync``
consumes.

In Docker this is what makes one image serve any backend: bake ``prefetch``
as a real layer (point ``UV_CACHE_DIR`` at an in-image path and do **not** use
a ``--mount=type=cache``) so the cache ships *inside* the image. The container
then picks its combination at run time — the first ``uv run --extra ...`` (or an
explicit ``sync <extras...>``) builds ``.venv`` from the baked cache, offline —
instead of hard-coding one combo at build time. Do **not** use ``prefetch`` as a
runtime sync.

This driver exposes one GPU torch "world" plus a CPU slice, all in one lock:
the cu13.0 / torch-2.11 backends (vllm, sglang, fsdp, megatron) and the
GPU-free ``cpu`` slice. They never mix in one ``.venv`` (see the conflict
sets). On top of whichever one you pick sit the conflict-free *add-ons*
(``math``, ``ci``, ``veomni-sft``) — extras that carry no torch of their own,
so CI composes them freely, e.g.::

    python manage_envs.py sync sglang megatron ci

``prefetch`` scopes the cache warm via the ``cu130`` shortcut so the
Docker image bakes only its backends. DEFERRED (commented out in
pyproject.toml until they support torch-2.11 / cu130): the cu12.9 /
torch-2.9.1 world (veomni, nemoautomodel) and trtllm (a CUDA-13 RC sdist).

CPU architecture
----------------
The same lock covers **x86_64 and aarch64** Linux (GH200 / GB200), because
``[tool.uv].environments`` declares a marker for each. Architecture is a
*resolution* dimension, not an extra dimension: nothing below branches on it,
the extra names and conflict sets are identical on both, and ``uv sync`` picks
each wheel by the host's own platform tag. So every command in this module is
spelled the same way on either machine — ``sync sglang megatron`` there is the
same ``sync sglang megatron`` here. See the ``environments`` comment in
pyproject.toml for how to split a single arch-specific package if one ever
appears.

Re-locking after a dependency change
------------------------------------
Edit ``pyproject.toml`` (and the matching apt deb in
``docker/Dockerfile.uv.cu130`` if it's a system lib), then::

    python manage_envs.py lock          # refresh uv.lock
    python manage_envs.py sync <combo>  # validate locally
    git add pyproject.toml uv.lock

    Two steps. (1) Resolve the universal ``uv.lock`` from ``pyproject.toml``
    (``uv lock``) so prefetch OWNS the lockfile: pyproject is the single source
    of truth and no pre-existing lock is required (it is a no-op rewrite when
    the lock is already current). (2) Warm the cache for the requested extras
    (positional args; default all of ``ALL_EXTRAS``, or the ``cu130`` shortcut
    to bake the Docker image's backends).
    Because the backends conflict, there is no single env that holds them all,
    so it syncs the conflict-free runtime combos from ``_covering_combos()``
    (one inference engine + one training backend each) into **throwaway**
    environments purely to download and build their third-party distributions
    into the uv cache (``$UV_CACHE_DIR``, default ``~/.cache/uv``), pinned with
    ``--frozen`` to the lock from step 1. ``--no-install-project`` skips verl
    itself (local source, rebuilt cheaply by the real ``sync``), keeping this
    step independent of the verl source tree. The project ``.venv`` is never
    created or touched.

    ``uv lock`` reads only ``pyproject.toml`` + the declared
    ``[tool.uv.dependency-metadata]``, so it triggers NO source build — the
    git-sourced megatron-core / mbridge are compiled in step 2, not here (apex /
    TE / flash-attn ship prebuilt from the wheelhouse, vllm / sglang /
    sglang-kernel prebuilt from PyPI).

    Use it once after cloning, or in a Docker layer so both the lock and the
    cache ship *inside* the image: bake it as a real layer (no
    ``--mount=type=cache``) and a later ``sync <extras...>`` resolves from the
    baked ``uv.lock`` + cache offline. For an actual runtime env use
