"""Driver-side checkpoint callback hook for the v1 PPO trainer.

Users plug in a custom callback by setting ``trainer.checkpoint_callback_class``
to the fully qualified class name of a :class:`CheckpointCallback` subclass.
The trainer instantiates it on the driver process and calls :meth:`CheckpointCallback.on_save`
after each checkpoint save, mirroring the ``on_save`` event of the HuggingFace
``transformers`` ``TrainerCallback``. The hook runs only on the driver, after the
worker-group RPCs; per-rank hooks inside the FSDP/Megatron checkpoint managers
are out of scope.

Exceptions raised by the hook propagate and abort training: checkpoint callbacks
typically perform durability-critical side effects (uploading shards, registering
a model version), and silently swallowing a failure could lose checkpoints without
any signal. Wrap the hook body in ``try/except`` for best-effort semantics.
