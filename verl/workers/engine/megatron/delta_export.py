"""Megatron-side delta export machinery, built on Megatron-Bridge param mappings.

The delta engine consumes final HF-coordinate entries; everything mcore-specific
lives here: enumerating parameters through :meth:`AutoBridge.get_conversion_tasks`,
routing each parameter's entries to its wire merge group, and probing the
bridge's own ``megatron_to_hf`` converters with NaN sentinels to translate a
shard-local delta into HF coordinates.

The probe never runs a collective, yet executes the mapping's REAL parallel
code paths: a "group" carries two separable meanings -- its SIZE/RANK (which
value math like Mamba's ``local_dim = global // tp_size`` consumes) and its
COMMUNICATION. The probe copies keep the first faithful and replace only the
second: groups become :class:`_ProbeGroup` (real size/rank, any actual use for
communication raises), and the bridge's comm helpers are stubbed with local
synthesis -- ``gather_from_tp_ranks`` returns this rank's shard at its true
rank index with NaN placeholders for every other rank (their contributions are
exported by those ranks' own probes). Feeding ``megatron_to_hf`` the LOCAL
shard as a NaN buffer with the rank's own delta scattered in yields HF tensors
whose non-NaN survivors are exactly this rank's contributions in final HF
coordinates.

Scope (asserted in the exporter): TP + EP, PP=1, VPP=1, no LoRA.

Safety boundary: communication must stay confined to the four stubbed helpers
(``gather_from_tp_ranks`` / ``gather_from_ep_ranks[_scale]`` / the PP
broadcasts, whose ``pp_size == 1`` fast path the probe keeps) -- anything else
touching a probe group raises instead of skewing silently. The remaining
assumption is that transforms REARRANGE elements rather than arithmetically
BLEND chunks (blending would eat the NaN sentinels); the TP>1 differential
test (real ``megatron_to_hf`` vs probe assembly, bitwise) is the regression
oracle for both assumptions on every Megatron-Bridge upgrade.
